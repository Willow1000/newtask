0. plugins and setup (everything here should already be setup, just double check)
use the camera plugin (should already be setup as well):
 turn on the expand pitch limit
 expand outer zoom limit: 200 
 zoom speed: 100
 control function: None
zoom out as much as you can and mark the tiles in this way
make sure you are at zoom 100% in your computer and 1920x1080 resolution, or as high as you can go, in order to take the pictures
to mark the pictures on screen you have to have the object markers plugin (this plugin should already be setup as well)

1. the plugins I mentioned above should already be set, if they are not set for you, maybe you have an older version of the config, make sure you ask me for the correct 
 version of the config file

2.before marking the tiles, you should press the 'w' key until you see the game from above (a bird eye view of the game if you will), this 
 makes it easier to mark the tiles

3.understand that the are of the game you see is not a square, what does this mean?, well if you mark something horizontally
 the next time the game is running the camera may not be in the same position, so the tile you marked may not be visible, the purpose 
  of marking the tiles is to make sure they are always visible, to ensure this happens, make sure you always mark the tiles vertically
this means that whenever you mark a tile, you must change the game camera with the 'a' and 'd' keys until the place you want to mark is above you

special things to take into account when creating the movements:
 make sure you understand 3. before starting, or you will have to restart, because the colors will be offscreen when the camera angle changes
 make sure not to use a light blue color when marking the tiles
 the purpose of marking the tiles with colors is to make sure that tile color ON SCREEN is unique at any time, 
  if you mark the tile color the same as any other color on screen or any other possible color on screen, you will to recreate
    the tile marks, make sure to remember what the purpose of this is, this is also the reason why you CAN NOT use a light blue color
     when marking the tiles
 make sure you do a couple of movement files and get feedback, before moving on to do more movements
 when marking other objects that are not tiles, like doors or other things on the map, you mark them the same way with shift+right click, 
  make sure you add those object colors to the color_map file, AND REMEMBER the purpose is that the colors are unique ON screen
 to reference an object in the movement file, you can do something like in the following example:
  InitialColor: color_ditch
  FinalColor: FFA93AB5
  ColorPattern: (FFDF808E,FFE54B62,FFE5213F)
 instead of a color, the initial color is a reference to an object, this must have the same name as in the color_map file: 
  the color map needs to have the color_ditch color setup
  in this example, the color map can look something like this: 
    default_blue: FF00FAFA
    wilderness_ditch: FFA93AB6
    clerk: FF880A0A
  as you can see: wilderness_ditch: FFA93AB6, is the reference to the color you use in the movement file, NOTICE that it must have the same name
  
  
other considerations:
 when an npc talks to you the zoom is reset though, this must automatically be taken into account, 
  whoever creates the movement file, doesnt need to take this into account, the program MUST handle this automatically,
   this problem is mentioned here because the engineers must be aware of this problem
