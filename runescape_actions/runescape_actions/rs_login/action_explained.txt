# this is an example, it doesnt have to be so explainy, but it should be clear enough to understand, so it is expected for this 
 # to be quite descriptive, I want to know what is happening without having to read the action_description.py file
  # notice that this is not meant to translate 1 to 1 against the steps in action_description.py
# never forget the 3rd line: new_plugin_list: in case you had to setup a new plugin in your action, and you will also have 
 # to add a "sub" action that will setup that plugin
