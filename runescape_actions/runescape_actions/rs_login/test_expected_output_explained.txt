the idea and the reason this file exists:
 this exists because when I open the test output images and when I see something strange, like a missing file or a black image, for some unpredictable reason, 
  I want it to be properly documented and explained why that is happening

 
TODO:
  add plugin warning window verifications (step 1 and 2 images) 
  step 2,3 are still incomplete, I require to be able to reproduce those problems in order to take the pictures, these 
   problems are only reproducible when an update is released
    I need to send a discord notification in the 'check' field

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
  step id: "random_movement_for_check_world_step" is ignored, since it's a union step
  step id: "loop_until_world_selected" is a loop, the first image iteration of the loop is expected to fail, 
   since the world was not selected yet, however, all subsequent iterations are expected to pass, however, this assumes 
    that the precision is as is in the step's description, if precision is lowered the first image will be able to match a wrong image
  step 13 is expected to have failures, since it's a jump step and tests multiple verify images
  step 17, 19, 20 is expected to be ignored, tests keyboard
  step 20 always jumps, so it's not expected to produce output
