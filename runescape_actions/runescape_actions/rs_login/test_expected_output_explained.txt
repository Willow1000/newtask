the idea and the reason this file exists:
 this exists because when I open the test output images and when I see something strange, like a missing file or a black image, for some unpredictable reason, 
  I want it to be properly documented and explained why that is happening

 
TODO:
  add plugin warning window verifications (step 1 and 2 images) 
  step 2,3 are still incomplete, I require to be able to reproduce those problems in order to take the pictures, these 
   problems are only reproducible when an update is released
    I need to send a discord notification in the 'check' field

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
  step 8 is ignored, since it's a union step
  step 12 is expected to have failures, since it tests against multiple different test images
  step 13 is expected to have failures, since it's a jump step and tests multiple verify images
  step 17, 19, 20 is expected to be ignored, tests keyboard
  step 20 always jumps, so it's not expected to produce output
