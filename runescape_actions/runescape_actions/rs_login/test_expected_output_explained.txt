the idea and the reason this file exists:
 this exists because when I open the test output images and when I see something strange, like a missing file or a black image, for some unpredictable reason, 
  I want it to be properly documented and explained why that is happening

 
TODO:
  add plugin warning window verifications (step 1 and 2 images) 
  step 2,3 are still incomplete, I require to be able to reproduce those problems in order to take the pictures, these 
   problems are only reproducible when an update is released
    I need to send a discord notification in the 'check' field

** the following is just an example of what you can explain, the only REAL thing that you really need to explain here is 
 the step id: "loop_until_world_selected", cause it explains the increase in base precision decision made there
EXPECTED OUTPUT:
  step id: "random_movement_for_check_world_step" is ignored, since it's a union step
  step id: "loop_until_world_selected" is a loop, the first image iteration of the loop is expected to fail, 
   since the world was not selected yet, however, all subsequent iterations are expected to pass, however, this assumes 
    that the precision is as is in the step's description, if precision is lowered the first image will be able to match a wrong image
  step id: "loop_until_login_successful" is expected to have failures, since it's a jump step and tests multiple verify images 
  step ids: 
    "delete_and_reinsert_pw",  
    "delete_and_reinsert_username" 
     are expected to be ignored, tests keyboard
  step id:  "loop_to_retry_login" always jumps, so it's not expected to produce output
