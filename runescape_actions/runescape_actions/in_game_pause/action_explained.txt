trade_at_exchange
runescape

action consists of trading items in great exchange without deposit/withdrawals 
therefore, action assumes that you have enough inventory space, the items are sent to inventory and assumed to be in 
 the inventory at the time of action execution
between runs of this trade_at_exchange action, it is assumed that the bot deposits any profits/losses from the previous 
 run of trade_at_exchange, this action is supposed to not really maintain state between executions
before this action starts, a different action should be executed to ensure that the bot has enough inventory space/enough gold to 
 trade/enough grand exchange available slots, a proper setup full clean up of all of these things
