[2] setup videos: the 'tools for images' folder shows a guide on how to get started taking custom screenshots
 of the game, some videos on how to do it, a text guide, some tools, etc., this is how the people 
  taking the screenshots will use these tools and how they will upload the images for you, it's 
   basically how they see things, all you care about here is the video_guides folder that shows you
    how to take screenshots, etc., to use these same tools they use, you will be following 
     your own guides, and using these tools in slightly different ways
